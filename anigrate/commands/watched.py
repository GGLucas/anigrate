    watch [num] [date]: [selector]
        Add an entry to the series watch log for all series matching [selector].
        If no [num] is specified anigrate acts as if one additional episode was 
        watched in the current season. If [date] is specified the watch log 
        entries will have their watch dates set to this instead of the current
        date and time.

        [num] can be specified in various formats:

          [+-]x     Add or remove x episodes to the watched count.
                    Note that watch log entries can be lost if the count
                    is decreased beyond their starting position.
                     Examples: +1 +3 -1 -4

          x         Set the watched count to exactly x, adding and removing
                    log entries as necessary.
                     Examples: 5 12 24

          x/y       Set the watched count to exactly x, and simultaneously
                    set the current season's length to y.
                     Examples: 5/12 13/24 16/20

          x/        Set the watched count to exactly x, and simultanously
       or /x        set the current season's length to x as well. In other 
                    words, this marks the season as completed with x eps.
                     Examples: 14/ 22/ /26 /52

        See `help dates` for acceptable date formats.
