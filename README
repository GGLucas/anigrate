Anigrate
simple cli watch list management
--------------------------------

About
=====
Anigrate is a simple, no-nonsense watch list manager for anime and tv
series made for people who like to do most of their work in a shell,
yet want something full-featured to keep track of their series for
them.

Features include a full log view of everything ever watched, a public
web list for showing off or simply for a pretty view of your watch list
and detailed statistics about your watching behaviour.

Anigrate uses a simple sqlite database in your home directory by
default, there's no need to configure or set anything up other than the
main binary. However, if you want to, you can connect to a remote mysql
database and keep track of your watch list centrally. The web interface
can be run stand-alone with a simple command, but can also be used
through wsgi (and, if flup is installed, you can run an fcgi or scgi
server).


Features
========
 * Full per-episode watch log including seasons.
 * Extensive series selector system for easy target specification.
 * Organisation of series into multiple categories.
 * Setting per episode duration individually per series, and
   calculating the total time spent watching from this.
 * Specifying your rating for a series and sorting by rating.
 * Various watch statistics; episodes watched per month/year/day of
   the week/hour of the day/etc.
 * View-only weblist server (http, wsgi, fcgi, scgi) that can display
   all this information in a pretty public list.
 * [New] Import database from myanimelist.net or anidb.net export
   formats.
 * Support for local or remote databases in any format supported by
   sqlalchemy.

Usage Examples
==============

   In its most basic form, anigrate is rather easy to use, some examples
   for common watch list management tasks:

 * Adding a new series

   $ anigrate add

   The add command will prompt you for any information required, then adds
   a new series with that information. Alternatively you can specify them
   manually:
    $ anigrate add anime: Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu
    $ anigrate add tv: how i met your mother

 * Incrementing a series watch count

   $ anigrate watch: how i met your mother

   This command will increment the watch count on the specified series and
   display the current log afterwards. You can also specify the amount of
   episodes or a specific episode number, as well as the total amount of
   episodes this season. Note that you don't need to type the entire name
   of the series, only the first bit.
    $ anigrate watch +3: how i
    $ anigrate watch 12/110: ginga

 * Viewing your current progress

   $ anigrate list: ginga eiyuu

   By using the list command, you can see how far along you are in a
   series. Not specifying any series (ie calling $ anigrate list) will
   show you your progress on every series.


Selectors
=========
   Selectors are used to find series to act upon. In its most basic form,
   a selector is simply the name of a series or the beginning of a name of
   a series (note that the selector will match any series that start with
   the specified name). Within the selector, the options listed below can
   be given.

 * +finished/+completed, +watching, +dropped, +undropped

   Put any of these in a separate argument anywhere in the selector and it
   will only match series that satisfy the condition.

 * =<category> =%<category>

   Will only match series in the specified category. If a % is specified,
   exactly match the category behind it, otherwise match any categories
   that start with the specified string.

 * %exact

   When specified, only match series that exactly match the full selector.

 * %contains

   When specified, match all series containing the selector.

 * %suffix

   When specified, match all series that end with the selector.

 * %prefix

   Default behaviour: match all series that start with the selector.

 * @rating, @activity, @watched, @title @-rating, @-activity, @-watched, @-title

   Set field to sort by, you can sort by series rating, series latest
   activity, amount of episodes watched and title respectively. Specifying
   a "-" reverses the order.

 * @split @-split

   Default sort method, sorts by activity but splits into watching,
   finished and dropped groups first.


Database Formats
================
Database formats are used to determine how to read or write series from
or to a file, the following format specifiers are available:

 * csv

   Uses a simple csv file with series titles and other info.

 * anidb

   Uses anidb.net's csv-minimal MyList export template.

 * myanimelist [IMPORT ONLY]

   Uses myanimelist.net's xml export format. When importing from
   myanimelist be sure to uncompress it before feeding it to anigrate; you
   can use pipes for this. For example:
   $ gunzip -c animelist_0000_-_0000.xml.gz | anigrate import -
   myanimelist


Date Formats
============
Some commands allow a date to be specified as an argument. By default,
dates are parsed in YYYYMMDD format. If the `dateutil` package has been
installed on the system, any format that can be parsed by it becomes
acceptable.


Commands
========
See `%(command)s help $command` for extended information about the
arguments and usage of a specific command.

You can use the shortest unambiguous form to specify each of these
commands (for example "li" will suffice for "list" and both "hi" and
"hist" will suffice for "history").

Positional arguments can be set to a single period character (".") in
order to specify they should remain set to their default values.


Configuration
=============
There are a number of configuration options available to be set. The
default location for your config file is in $HOME/.anigrate/config. You
can print a list of options currently set by running `anigrate config`.
The following configuration options are available, run `anigrate help
$OPTION` for more information about one of them, or run `anigrate help
options` to see the complete list of extended information.
